# terraform-network-edge-aws
Terraform Network Edge with AWS VC.

This repo will allow you to create an Equinix Network Edge device using a Cisco CSR1000V Small with the security package applied. Once created it will create the required Equinix Fabric virtual connection (VC) to AWS, where a private VIF and BGP peering will be created to peer with network edge.
